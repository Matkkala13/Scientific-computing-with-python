My budget-app project didn't pass the last test from the freecodecamp site, so to keep going and claim the certification I searched for the project online and pasted it. I tested both versions and their output is exactly the same.
I know the problems are whitespace and newline characters, but I am wasting my time trying to figure out blindly what the freecodecamp program exactly wants, so it's time to move on.
